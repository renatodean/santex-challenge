# Santex Challenge

This project it's only meant for demonstrating my knowledge with React, Styled components, Javascript, etc., this repository contains a simple Ecommerce, fetching the products from this [`Graphql API`](https://demo.vendure.io/shop-api).

For this project I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and Vercel for deployment.

The project it's also configured to use Typescript and for Styling I use Styled components with [`Emotion`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the list of products, then you can navigate a single product and then got to the checkout from the cart.

## Deploy on Vercel

This project it's deployed in Vercel and you can check this project live [here](https://santex-challenge.vercel.app/).
